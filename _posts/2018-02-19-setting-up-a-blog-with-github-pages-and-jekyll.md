# Setting up a blog with GitHub Pages and Jekyll
- Set up a GitHub Pages repository
- Set up a Jekyll and Jekyll project
- Choose a themes
- Configure DNS

> **Prerequisites:** GitHub account and Git client of your choice (instructions use command line git)

# Set up a GutHub Pages repository
Go to <https://pages.github.com/> and follow the guide for user/organization site or project site. I choose a user site, so I create a new repository called `ynovytskyy.github.io` in my GitHub account since my username is `ynovytskyy`. If I was using a payed account, I could choose a **Private** repo.
I'm going to use a command line Git client in `bash` shell:
```bash
mkdir ~/work
cd ~/work
#the following line might differ based on your git setup preference
git clone git@github.com:ynovytskyy/ynovytskyy.github.io.git
cd ynovytskyy.github.io/
echo "hello from GitHub Pages" > index.html
git add .
git commit -m "added index.html"
git push
open https://ynovytskyy.github.io
```
At this point GitHub Pages is serving your static website from the master branch of your repository. This might be all that you need. If it is, you could just go to **Configure DNS** section if you want to serve your site under your custom domain and continue to evolve your site in the repository.

# Set up a Jekyll and Jekyll project
I choose to use Jekyll to handle my GitHub Pages website. This is for several reasons:
- I will write my posts in plain markdown and Jekyll will generate the website pages for me following a theme chosen by me
- GitHub Pages supports Jekyll internally, so that I push my `*.md` files only and it will be pure GitHub Pages generating website for me
- Jekyll/GitHub Pages support themes to choose from; internal and 3rd party
- Jekyll has a lot plugins; GitHub Pages supports only limited set of plugins for security reasons, but it does have support for `DISQUS`

So roughly following this guide: <https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/>

```bash
ruby --version
#should be 2.1.0 or higher, if not https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
gem install bundler
#in the root directory of your local Jekyll site repository
echo "source 'https://rubygems.org'" > Gemfile
echo "gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins" >> Gemfile
bundle install
#preserve GitHub Pages version of `Gemfile`, delete `index.html` example from section 1
cp Gemfile Gemfile.githubpages
rm index.html
bundle exec jekyll _3.3.0_ new . --force
cp Gemfile Gemfile.jekyll
mv Gemfile.githubpages Gemfile
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The last command will generate and start Jekyll site locally on port `4000`. Open <http://localhost:4000/> to see the your site locally before you push it to the GitHub repo and therefore publish it.

Notice one post `Welcome to Jekyll!` that was generated by default.

While Jekyll is running locally you can make changes to your site and it will pick them up as soon as you save the file. Press `Ctrl+c` to stop running Jekyll locally.

## Add a post in markdown
Make sure that you are in the root directory of your local Jekyll site repository and create a post as an `.md` file using the following command or your favorite text editor:
```bash
#in the root directory of your local Jekyll site
cat <<EOT >> _posts/greetings.txt
# My first awesome post
How cool is that?
- MD - easy to read as plain text
- And **beautiful** when rendered as website
- And here's [how to do it](http://www.novytskyy.com/2018/02/19/setting-up-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-jekyll.html "Setting up a blog with GitHub Pages and Jekyll")

EOT
```









Following the setup of the `so-simple-theme` at <https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme>

Modify `_config.yml` in the root of you GitHub Pages Jekyll site to contain:
```yml
remote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme"
disqus:
  shortname: ynovytskyy
```

# Choose and apply Jekyll Theme
GitHub Pages supports official and third-party themes. They are applied in slightly different way.
- GitHub Pages Supported Themes <https://pages.github.com/themes/>
- A list of 3rd party themes on GitHub <https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme>
Themes I liked:
- Cayman nice except colors and a big header <https://pages-themes.github.io/cayman/>
- Leap Day not good, but nice code blocks <https://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day/>
- Minima not bad but too simple <https://jekyll.github.io/minima/>
- Minimal kinda nice, but two columns, too simplistic <https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/>
- Modernist nice except colors <https://pages-themes.github.io/modernist/>
- **3rd party**
- so-simple-theme <https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/markup-syntax-highlighting/>
- <https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/>
- <https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/>

## Next is some **Python** code example
This is an example of a plain text paragraph, but the following paragraph should be a pre-formatted `Python` code.
```python

  print('hello %s' % item)
```

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
